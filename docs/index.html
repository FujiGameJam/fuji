Introduction</h1>
<p>Mount Fuji is a cross platform game engine which aims to provide a set of features and tools which can be used to radically simplify the development process of games on modern hardware.<br/>
Mount Fuji provides a rich API which supports most flavours of PC and modern Consoles. While Mount Fuji is internally developed in C/C++ and Assembly, it is accessible by a variety of languages as a statically and dynamically linkable library.<br/>
The Mount Fuji engine also provides a set of data and asset management tools designed to take game assets developed in a wide variety of art and asset packages in game. Assets are converted to internal platform specific data formats to maximise efficiency and performance on all available platforms.<br/>
The Mount Fuji engine is currently only available to internal developers and beta testers, but a public release is planned when development reaches a stable state.<br/>
For related questions or discussion, please refer to the Mount Fuji Forum.</p>

FAQ</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="question1"></a>
What platforms are currently supported by the Mount Fuji Engine?</h2>
<p>The Mount Fuji Engine has been successfully compiled and tested on the following platforms: Windows, Linux, PSP and XBox.<br/>
Other platforms in the works at various degrees of functionality include OSX, PS2, Gamecube and Dreamcast. (I'd appreciate more people to help me test these system)<br/>
System planned for support include PS3 (when it releases in australia using the OpenPlatform technology) and Wii (also via gamecube support).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="question2"></a>
What support is offered for internationalisation?</h2>
<p>The Mount Fuji Engine provides extensive support for internationalisation. The font functions are UTF8 and Unicode aware, and the engine has internal support for Unicode string, or more conveniently UTF8 encoding when using the standard string functions.<br/>
Tools are provided for managing translations and string tables.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="question3"></a>
What asset formats are supported?</h2>
<p>Asset files in typical formats are not directly loaded by the engine.<br/>
The engine is designed to load raw optimised platform specific asset formats. This is for efficiency and performance.<br/>
Tools are provided to convert many common asset formats into 'data archives' for consumption by the engine.<br/>
Supported formats include:<br/>
DAE (Collada), X, ASE, OBJ, MD2, MD3. Note: Animation is currently only supported through the DAE and X formats.<br/>
PNG, TGA, BMP.<br/>
WAV, OGG.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="question4"></a>
Are sample applications provided?</h2>
<p>Yes, samples are provided for some typical tasks.<br/>
Further questions/support can be brought to me directly.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="question5"></a>
Is this gonna be able to make pron games on PSP?</h2>
<p>Sure, if thats what does it for you ;)</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="credits_sec"></a>
Special Thanks</h1>
<p>Special thanks go to all the console homebrew communities who have produced fantastic tools for many platforms and found numerous exploits to make any of it even possible!<br/>
