; any other file extension will simply be added to the archive unprocessed..


; these are patterns to exclude files on, note the platform flags to masks when building the list
; this way different platforms can read data from different platform specific source directories
[exclude]
{
	/.svn/$    ; dont want subversion data in the archive

	.exe$
	.bat$
	.xls$      ; we dont want the translation source files in the archive

	.zip$      ; dont want archives in the archive
        .jpg$
        .jpeg$     ; jpegs are source images

	; all platforms EXCEPT PC will exclude PC platform specific data (folders with '_pc' on the end)

	_pc/$
